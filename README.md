# Quals
This is a repository for scripts that I am working on for a written qualification exam. These will be moved to another 
repository upon completion and final edits.

  This repository holds a series of scripts is intended to take the output of MarkerMiner (Chamala et al 2014) and format for 
and run dN/dS analyses in codeml (PAML; Yang 1997). My goal was to make a pipeline that was simple, transportable, and would 
work on large data sets. The pipeline runs in a Unix environment, requires perl, as well as several common biological tools, 
including: GetOrf (EMBOSS; Rice et al 2000), muscle (Edgar 2004), and the PAML package (Yang 1997). The pipeline is designed to
run from within the MarkerMiner output folders and take the aligned fasta outputs, extract open-reading frames, align the ORFs,
re-format for codeml, then run the analyses and clean-up any un-needed files.

How to run:
  First, you need your MarkerMiner output (or other folder of sequence files; scripts will require editing to fit the needs of 
the user if this is the case). Change your working directory to the fasta folder of the MarkerMiner output. From here, you can 
call on the master script. But, before running the script, there are several requirements to meet first: 1) make sure the paths
in the scripts are appropriate for your directory arrangement, 2) make sure that file extensions are standardized in your 
directories and in any edits you make to the scripts, 3) you must have the EMBOSS suite for GetOrf, muscle, and the PAML 
package to run the scripts to completion. Once all the requirements are met, all you have to do is run the master script (e.g.,
perl codeml_Master_script.pl) and voila! The pipeline should be up-and-running. In the end, you will be left with a folder for 
output files, a folder for the sequence files, and all intermediate files should be removed.
